    <string name="about_text">\ This game is played just like regular Tic Tac Toe with one difference: to win a tile you have to win a smaller game of Tic Tac Toe inside that tile.\n\ \n\ A tie happens when there are no further moves. In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for both sides in the larger game. </string>
